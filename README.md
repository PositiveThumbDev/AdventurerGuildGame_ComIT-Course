# AdventurerGuildGame_ComIT-Course
A series of smaller scripts that can be used in standalone real world cases, connected to a core script that runs them in a game. To show my capacity for both video game and real world app development.

Planned Features:
-A standalone banking app
-A standalone inventory management app
-More as I think and make them.
-A game app that uses the prior apps to power it's functions.

Planned Frameworks: I plan to use Django for now as an offline website, that will create, read, update and destroy data from an internal data base.

How to run application: Unsure at this time, for now it's run from the terminal and uses the default browser. This section will be updated once I have a better way.
