# AdventurerGuildGame_ComIT-Course
A first draft attempt to create a series of smaller apps for standalone realworld use and a large game app that would use the smaller apps during play. The goal was to show my capacity for both video game and real world app development. During this process I learned a lot and wish to start the project from scratch using what I have learned, this page is a record of my first steps. Check the "blame" section to see the history of the project up to this point.

Technologies and softwares used: The Django framework, the Python coding language, VSCode, Git and SQLite.

How to run application: At this moment I am considering what the best route would be for this, for now, you can open the project in VSCode, cd to AdventurersRespite and use command 'python manage.py runserver'. You will also need to run the 'python manage.py createsuperuser' command to create an admin user if you wish to access the admin backend.
